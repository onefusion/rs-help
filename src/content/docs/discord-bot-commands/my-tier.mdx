import { LinkCard } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Using this command you will be given a time-sensative link to the web app to view your tier team's availability. 
The link will remain active for 10 minutes after it is generated before becoming invalid. 
Use the discord bot command again to recieve a new link. 

Hovering over each time slot will show player's availability that has been filled in.
